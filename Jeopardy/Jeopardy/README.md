I just renamed my sql file to woonghel-a5.sql
if this doesn't for any reason, please use the one from a4.
(but I only renamed it. nothing else has been changed)

When you first load the main board windows, the time will be slightly off because
the windows do not open at the same time.

However, after that, the clock is perfectly synchronized and count down at a same rate.
one of the CP said it's okay if the clock was a bit off at first
